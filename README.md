## Deploying the app with Heroku
Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:
```
$ heroku create <name of the app>
```

Now deploy the code to Heroku:
```
$ git push heroku master
```

Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
```
$ heroku open
```

### Viewing logs
If you need to check the logs of the deployed app:
```
$ heroku logs --tail
```

## Running the app locally
You can run the app locally with Heroku:
```
$ heroku local
```
